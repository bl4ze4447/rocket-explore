this needs to be re-written in a diferent gui framework, maybe tauri.
e-gui has some issues which made me not able to progress further.

my expectations of this proejct:
- check system information and switch between a cpu-based (current) search or a memory-based search
- informative, it should tell you if you have files/folders in the clipboard
- offline and no account, there is no need to gather user info
- cross-compatible

i wanted to become familiar with rust while learning so this might just be a pile of crap for an experienced developer, either way I will keep working on it.
if you want to help, the biggest thing i need help with is moving it to a different framework :)
