this needs to be re-written in a diferent gui framework, maybe tauri.
e-gui has some issues which made me not able to progress further.
it also gives a fake virus alert because when you open files it uses the cmd line hidden to open it

the app has ctrL+click, shift+click and that selection stuff built

my expectations of this proejct:
- check system information and switch between a cpu-based (current) search or a memory-based search
- informative, it should tell you if you have files/folders in the clipboard
- offline and no account, there is no need to gather user info
- cross-compatible

the app needs a lot of work to be functional, it is not perfect but maybe with the help of someone else I can make this better.

i wanted to become familiar with rust while learning so this might just be a pile of crap for an experienced developer, either way I will keep working on it.
if you want to help, the biggest thing i need help with is moving it to a different framework :)
